# Fastrat

Fastrat is my personal and opinionated starter kit, based on technologies that I like to use.

* [Fastify](https://fastify.dev)
  * a fast well maintained web framework
* [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)
  * for frontend tooling and bundling
* [Vike](https://vike.dev)
  * a Vite plugin to create your own NextJS
* [Trpc](https://trpc.io/docs/server/adapters/fastify)
  * for end points with E2E type safety
* [Vavite](https://github.com/cyco130/vavite)
  * for running and compiling Node code with Vite
* [Turso db](https://turso.tech)
  * for easy to use SQL database
* [Fly.io](https://fly.io)
  * for deployment
